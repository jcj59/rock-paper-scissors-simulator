# Rock Paper Scissors Simulator

This is an entertaining game where rock, paper, and scissor sprites move semi-randomly around the screen and try to convert all other sprites.  I plan to use neuroevolution to train some of the sprites and make them more intelligent to increase their odds of winning.
